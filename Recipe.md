The Steps to make a cake are:

1) Mix all dry ingredients together lightly to distribute. (Flour, sugar, baking powder, salt).

2) Add in milk, butter, and vanilla. Stir until well mixed. (Old cookbook would suggest 100 strokes).

3) Beat in eggs. (300 strokes?? This depends on how light and fluffy you want you cake to be.)

4) Batter should now be uniform in texture and color. If not, continue to beat until uniformity reached.

5) Pouring the batter and baking times depend of the size of pan(s) you have chosen:

    a)CUPCAKES : Fill cups to 1/2 full. Should make approx 30 cupcakes.
                 Bake 20 mins or until toothpick comes out clean.

    b)13 X 9" PAN : Pour all batter into pan. Distribute bater evenly.
                    Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until tooth pick comes out clean.

    c)ROUND PANS : Divide batter evenly between both pans. Tap pans gentle to distribute batter evenly.
                   Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

    Note: Pans should be placed on the middle rack of a preheated oven.

6) Put the batter now in the oven for 45-50 minutes. A wooden pick inserted into the center of the cake to check if its perfectly baked or not. if baked, take the cake out.

Enjoy your cake any way you like it. Warn from the oven, as a lunchbox treat, or frosted and decorated.
